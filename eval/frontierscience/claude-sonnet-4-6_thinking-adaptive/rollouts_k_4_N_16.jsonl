Key Mechanistic Reasoning\n\nThe decisive experimental observation is that **TSA rescues exon inclusion even while CPT is still present** (i.e., Topo I remains inhibited and RNAP II elongation is still perturbed).

The faint residual 2.0 kb band under CPT + TSA conditions reflects a minor contribution from RNAP II perturbation by CPT, but the dominant rescue demonstrates chromatin state as the primary driver.\n\nAn additional point: CPT *slows* RNAP II elongation (via increased torsional stress), which under simple kinetic coupling would be expected to *favor* exon inclusion (more time for spliceosome assembly). Yet CPT causes exon **skipping**, ruling out simple kinetic coupling as the primary mechanism and further pointing to chromatin compaction via histone deacetylation as the dominant regulatory event.\n\nThis is consistent with the **kinetic coupling model** of co-transcriptional splicing, in which histone acetylation state governs RNAP II pausing behavior and recruits bromodomain-containing adaptor proteins that facilitate spliceosome assembly at alternative exons.\n\n---\n\n### 4.
